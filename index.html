                    <p>An anime adaptation of a very popular manga, a story so beautiful it will make you binge-watch multiple times until you can't get enough of it . So what's really special about horimiya? Unlike the popular shonen animes with bold and enthusiastic storylines, it stands out as a rather simple but elegant comfort anime. A very normal rom-com about normal teenagers in a normal high school who are trying to find out what exactly is normal. </p>

                    <h4>Kyoko Hori</h4>
                    <img src="img/hori.jpg" alt="">
                    <p>Kyouko is normally a very energetic and popular person who always creates a happy atmosphere around herself. She is a hard-worker in all aspects of her life and is academically sound. When nervous or embarrassed, she tends to switch to a violent state. Hori is somewhat of a masochist- however this is only when it comes to Miyamura. Over the course of the story, she does not seem to be too bothered with girls talking to Miyamura but instead, worries that he might love a man. She once told him that it's okay to love another woman but not a man</p>

                    <h4>Izumi Miyamura</h4>
                    <img src="img/miyamura.png" alt="">
                    <p>Izumi is a gloomy, weird high schooler or so he’s portrayed in the beginning of the anime. However, he’s not as pessimistic and gloomy natured as his batchmates make him out to be. He appears to have very low self-esteem and is very awkward when talking to people he's not close with, often saying he can't connect well with others.  Izumi is also quite laid-back towards his studies. He is very afraid of anything related to horror or gore but usually watches horror movies because Hori enjoys them. At times, Izumi can be rather dense and impulsive, which is likely the reason behind why he got his tattoos and his piercings.</p>

                    <h4>Yuki Yoshikawa</h4>
                    <img src="img/yuki.jpg" alt="">
                    <p>Yuki has a typical bubbly and ditzy personality and often creates a fun and happy atmosphere for those close to her. when Yuki doesn't want someone to know something, she tries to hide it by covering it with a smile and the more she doesn't want to let go of something, the less she talks about it. Yuki can come off as someone who easily feels jealousy. It is possible that Yuki may also have an inferiority complex, as she makes negative remarks directed towards herself.</p>

                <div class="card-2">
                    <h4>Toru Ishikawa</h4>
                    <img src="img/toru.png" alt="">
                    <p>Toru comes off as a normal character who’s initially shown as someone with warm feelings for Kyoko and is a bit violent though he doesn’t put up much of a fight. He’s a caring person who later develops feelings towards towards Yuki.</p>

                    <img src="img/sawada.png" alt="">
                    <p>Sawada is shown as a  character clingy towards Kyouko Hori hence she views Miyamura as a love rival, but also as a brotherly figure. She was very close to her older brother who passed away some years ago leaving a deep impact on her. </p>
